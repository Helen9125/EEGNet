# EEGNet
A deep learning model which is specially designed for EEG(Electroencephalography) data.  
In this study, we employed EEGNet, a deep learning model which is specially designed for EEG(Electroencephalography) data, to performed a binary classification task. EEGNet is a kind of convolutional neural network which is known for its ability to efficiently recognize the signal in EEG data. Therefore, this model can be used to capture temporal dynamic signals, allowing it well-suited for tasks requiring high resolution. By utilizing EEGNet, we classified EEG data in two categories.
